# Let Me Ask

A project using firebase for ranking questions in a room.

1. Users need to login with Google to create a room or like/send a question

1. A user can create a room about a subject and others users can enter the room and ask questions about it.

1. Users that are owners of the room can manage questions like: check has already answered, mark a question and delete a question.

1. Users can like other users questions so it goes up in the rank.
